## Intro

This repository contains Matlab scripts for **associative learning model** simulation. 

Currently, following models are implemented. 

- Rescorla-Wagner model [(Rescorla & Wagner, 1972)](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/233820243_A_theory_of_Pavlovian_conditioning_Variations_in_the_effectiveness_of_reinforcement_and_nonreinforcement)
- Mackintosh model [(Mackintosh, 1975)](https://psycnet.apa.org/record/1975-26802-001)
    - Implementation by [Moore and Stickney (1980)](https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.3758/BF03332852.pdf)
- Pearce-Hall model [(Pearce & Hall, 1980)](https://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.334.4309&rep=rep1&type=pdf)
- Schmajuk-Pearce-Hall model [(Schmajuk & Moore, 1985)](https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.3758/bf03326534.pdf)
- Esber-Haselgrove model [(Esber & Haselgrove, 2011)](https://royalsocietypublishing.org/doi/epdf/10.1098/rspb.2011.0836)
- Temporal Difference model [(Sutton & Barto, 1987)](https://philippe-preux.github.io/ensg/aeac/papiers/sutton-barto-TD-87.pdf)


## Projects

Following projects use or used these scripts for learning model simulation.

Clink the title to Go to the following folder/repo.


### [VDAC 2022 Thesis](https://github.com/knowblesse/Modeling/tree/main/VDAC)

Simulation & figure drawing scripts for **Value Driven Attentional Capture (VDAC)** thesis.

The manuscript is submitted on 2022SEP14 (KST).

The scripts include quantitative evaluation of models with global optimization.

Detailed information will be updated.


### [Korea University Conditioning Simulator (KUCS)](https://github.com/knowblesse/KUCS)

**GUI-based** Matlab application for Model Sitmulation.

This application was designed to be used for **educational purpose** such as learning material for an introductory psychology class.

I moved the application to the other repo, for continuous development. [https://github.com/knowblesse/KUCS](https://github.com/knowblesse/KUCS)

The application along with a detailed instruction manual can be found on the repo.

### [KSBNS 2021 Poster presentation](https://github.com/knowblesse/Modeling/tree/main/KSBNS)

Figure drawing scripts for **The 24th Annual Meeting of the Korean Society for Brain Neural Science (KSBNS)** Poster presentation.

The presented poster can be found in the following link. [Poster.pdf](https://github.com/knowblesse/Modeling/blob/main/KSBNS/Poster.pdf)

Main findings of the study are **1) the development of KUCS** and **2) the model comparison on partial reinforcement**.

Later, this data is published in the Korean Journal of Cognitive and Biological Psychology. 


### [Korean Journal of Cognitive and Biological Psychology Thesis](https://github.com/knowblesse/Modeling/tree/main/CogBioPsy)

Figure drawing scripts for [Jeong et al. (2021)](https://10.22172/cogbio.2021.33.4.004).

### [JModel](https://github.com/knowblesse/Modeling/tree/main/JModel)

Momentum & uncertainty-based associative learning model.

Currently developing a new associative learning model.
